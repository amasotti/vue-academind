      <ul>
        <li>
          <b class="fancyBox">Methods:</b> obligatory with listeners but can be used for any purpose (data and event
          bindings). Methods are the most basic feature in Vue. They're executed every render-cycle. You should use them
          if you really want you're props to be re-evaluated at each re-rendering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="fancyBox">Computed:</b> Can be used with data bindings but not with events or methods. The props are
          re-evaluated only if one of variables inside the <em>computed</em> methods changes. This is great if some data
          depend on other data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="fancyBox">Watch:</b> These cannot be invoked directly in the HTML (contrary to methods and computed)
          but are constantly listening in the backround to data carrying the same name. They're useful for side-effects
          involving just one variable. Typical use cases are
          <em>do something if the counter becomes negative or bigger than X</em> . Watchers react to some changed data,
          they're not recommended if you need to watch to many data at the same time. In that case use
          <code>computed</code>
