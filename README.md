# Academind Vue3

This repo contains my coding-along for each chapter of the Academind course on Vuejs v. 3.
This repo is neither a complete resource-repo for the academind course nor substitutes the course. It's just me having fun with Vuejs.


## What's missing:

* _The videos (too big to be uploaded on github)_
* _Many parts that I felt too boring to code with_
