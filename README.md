# Academind Vue3

This repo contains my coding-along for each chapter of the Academind course on Vuejs v. 3.
This repo is neither a complete resource-repo for the academind course nor substitutes the course. It's just me having fun with Vuejs.


...and in case you're thinking if it's worth to take the course...yes, definitely. Max is a great teacher no matter what's your current level.

## What's missing:

* _The videos (too big to be uploaded on github)_
* _Many parts that I felt too boring to code with_
